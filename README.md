<h2>Description</h2>

This project is the second class of <i>Jornada Python</i> from <i>Hastag Treinamentos</i> and it consists in a
data analysis project, whose purpose is to analyze the reasons behind the cancellation rate for the services
offered by a fictitious company. 
The database for this project is the ```cancelamentos.csv``` file, which contains informations like the number of times that a customer called to call center (<i>ligacoes_callcenter column</i>), type of contract that a customer have/had (<i>assinatura column</i>), number of days a customer was late paying (<i>dias_atraso column</i>), whether the customer canceled the contract or not, and much more information. 
In this project it was used ```jupyter``` and some libraries like ```pandas```, ```plotly``` and ```nbformat```, to analyze the database graphically and numerically.

<h2>How to install and run the project</h2>

You need to clone the repository by doing the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/leoGeraldino/aula2_jornadaPython.git```

In ```VSCode```, you need to install the extension ```Jupyter``` from ```Microsoft``` (I recommend this extension).

After this step, you need to configure a virtual environment, like this:
```python -m venv <virtual_environment_name>```

And activate it: 
```<virtual_environment_name>\Scripts\activate```

Finally, you need to instal the ```requirements.txt``` file, like this:
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` and so you are almost ready to run the code.

Before run all the Jupyter code blocks, you need to open and run ```combine_file.py```, which combines all the ```main.ipynb``` files in just one file. After this step, you can run the code, block by block, to see the analysis done.

<h2>How to use the project</h2>

This project was built just for didactic purposes, but you can modify it according to your needs. For example, you can analyze another databases to find some problems in another companies, or you can analyze some <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> databases. Feel comfortable to use it as you need.
